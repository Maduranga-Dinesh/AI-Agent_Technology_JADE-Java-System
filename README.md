# AI-Agent_Technology_JADE-Java-System

Introduction
Multi-agent systems (MASs) are a new and promising area in the field of distributed
artificial intelligence (DAI), as well as in mainstream computer science. These systems are
compounds of relatively autonomous and intelligent parts, called agents. The E-Library system
is designed using multi-agent technology.
Multi-specialist frameworks have been significantly adding to the advancement of the
hypothesis and the act of mind-boggling appropriated frameworks and, specifically, they have
shown the possibility to address basic issues in high velocity, crucial, content-rich, and
dispersed data applications where shared interdependencies, dynamic conditions, vulnerability,
and complex control assume a part.
Previous online library management system (LMS) acts as a tool to search books online
and purchase or read books. The e-library multi agent system supports the e-libraries to
encounter all the issues concurrently. The users donâ€™t wait in a queue for a long period to find a
version of books from the e-library. The single system contains all the data's in it. The users
have to assess the system and provide an entry in it. Through the system the users can find the
books with versions in the bookshelves. The system is designed with the basic features such as
users can purchase, search books with latest versions.
